# Industrial-Blueprint-Import-Service



This is a project from EVE-Online community members to ease the industrials day-to-day life.

We will provide an extensive Toolkit that's easy to use for the common miner or industrial.

For just basic use: [api](http://noodel.me/api.php)

Do it like this: `noodel.me/api.php?typename="provide a typename here"&regionid="regionid pls"`

The typename may include spaces.

For the Documentation and how to install this services on your own server take look at the [wiki](https://github.com/GoeDev/IndustrialToolkit/wiki).


## Roadmap
